    "text": "Fun fact\n\nLight fun fact: I am fluent in German. Ich kann fliessend Deutsch sprechen.\nDeep fun fact: I was always confident as a mathematician and mathematics student but presumed myself to not be “good enough” to learn about computers. I took a CS course in my undergraduate career because it was required of me. As a student of Discrete Mathematics, I was exposed to a lot of computational thinking principals but STILL was afraid to learn to code. Throughout my entire career as a teacher I have had to step up and teach Computer Science because I was the only person willing to do it. Now as I look back on a decade of highly talented female math students who demonstrate the same fears that I too carried, I have for the first time elected to take a computational course by signing up for this class. I didn’t “have to” take this course, I “chose to” and I want to develop the skills to analyze and support all students in STEM at my school."

The item that was captured the most in the data was chicken with 13,074 observations along with ducks at 6,909 observations, turkeys at 5,693 observations, geese and guinea fowls at 4,136 observations, and pigeons and other birds at 1,165 observations. This data was collected from 1961 to 2018 and the number of data observations gathered each year increased steadily from 493 in 1961 to 577 in 2018, most likely due to the advancement and availability of technology to keep track of livestock. According to the table for the Flag Description, the majority of the data is considered official (10,773 observations) while 1,002 observations did not have data available."

    "text": "Anticipate the End Result\nThe first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product should look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.\nOne easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.\nSuppose you have a dataset with \\(n\\) rows and \\(k\\) variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting \\(k-3\\) variables into a longer format where the \\(k-3\\) variable names will move into the names_to variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the values_to variable. Therefore, we would expect \\(n * (k-3)\\) rows in the pivoted dataframe!\n\nExample: find current and future data dimensions\nLets see if this works with a simple example.\n\n\nCode\ndf<-tibble(country = rep(c(\"Mexico\", \"USA\", \"France\"),2),\n           year = rep(c(1980,1990), 3), \n           trade = rep(c(\"NAFTA\", \"NAFTA\", \"EU\"),2),\n           outgoing = rnorm(6, mean=1000, sd=500),\n           incoming = rlogis(6, location=1000, \n                             scale = 400))\ndf\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  country  year trade outgoing incoming\n  <chr>   <dbl> <chr>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 Mexico   1980 NAFTA    1221.     259.\n2 USA      1990 NAFTA     567.    1420.\n3 France   1980 EU       1408.     674.\n4 Mexico   1990 NAFTA     709.     539.\n5 USA      1980 NAFTA     775.     355.\n6 France   1990 EU       1000.    1328.\n\n\nCode\n#existing rows/cases\nnrow(df)\n\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nCode\n#existing columns/cases\nncol(df)\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nCode\n#expected rows/cases\nnrow(df) * (ncol(df)-3)\n\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nCode\n# expected columns \n3 + 2\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nOr simple example has \\(n = 6\\) rows and \\(k - 3 = 2\\) variables being pivoted, so we expect a new dataframe to have \\(n * 2 = 12\\) rows x \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) columns.\n\n\nChallenge: Describe the final dimensions\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n\nAny additional comments?"
