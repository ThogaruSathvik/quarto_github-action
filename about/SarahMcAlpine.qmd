## Education/Work Background

I have been working in higher ed fundraising for 8 years; I am a project manager, storyteller, and database and operations backbone of my department.

## R experience

This is my first time using R!

## Research interests

I may use some anonymized data from work about alumni and donor engagement, and I'm also interested in ecological studies about native plants in New England--and I'm always curious and open to new fields of study!

## Hometown

Easthampton, MA

## Hobbies

Native plant and meadow gardening, reading, journaling, meditation.

## Fun fact

I enrolled in this certificate program very suddenly this week after years of considering it.
